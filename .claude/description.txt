Restaurant Booking System - Razor Pages Web App

Objective: Create a web application for managing restaurant bookings.

Several restaurants (capacity, location), tables (seat amount), clients (name, email, phone), bookings (number of guests)...

Requirements:

Implement CRUD operations for restaurants and reservations.
Allow customers to book a table for a specified date and time.
Include logic to check the availability of tables based on capacity.
Provide functionality for customers to view their bookings.
Search functionality - name & availability & capacity

Generally speaking - these are only broad guidelines. Please write a solution that you would like to present to the world as your best effort in programming and app-designing (UX is the key).

Use nullable references, and turn all the warnings into errors!
